<h1>NFTY COIN</h1>

<p>
    The following images are the output of the program after successfull execution. \n
    This program generates a random 6-character string then converts that into an image in the form of a 6-ring coin. \n
    Each ring, regardless of diameter, corresponds to an ascii character from the random generated 6-character string. \n 
    The coin is always an embossed gold. The background is a gradient of two random colors.
