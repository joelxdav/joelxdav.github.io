    <h3>Project Details</h3>
    <p>
        An automated dashboard to display otherwise manually generated information used for Real Estate Photography and related processes. REP Dashboard takes photoshoot information from Google Calendar, aggregates it via Google Sheets, then presents it dynamically as a web app. When used, this centralized hub eliminated approximately 10 hours a month in manual data entry, provided data insights over time (like a heat map), and improved time management.

        <strong>Note:</strong> "REP" is an acronym for real estate photographer. "REP Dashboard" was changed from its original name to avoid copyrighting.
